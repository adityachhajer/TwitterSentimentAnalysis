# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
Sentiment analysis tool for identifying the sentiment of the tweets as positive, negative and neutral. 

Sentiement analysis also known as opinion mining is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words, used to gain an understanding of the the attitudes, opinions and emotions expressed within an online mention of posts and the various hashtags which are a trend today.
So I have made this tool, known as Twitter sentiment analysis which will analyze the tweets posted by a particular user or tweets on a particular hashtag and will classify those tweets on the basis of positive, negative or neutral. It will also show the Tweet Id as well as the retweet count, so as to know the trending level of that particular tweet.
